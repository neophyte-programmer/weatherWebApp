# Weather Web Application

## <p align= "center"> Overview </p>
This is a web application that enables the user search for the real time weather of a particular city. The unique thing about this web application is responsive background images. 
When the user search for the weather of a place, the background images show images from that city. Wonderful, isn't it?

## <p align= "center"> Experience </p>
Granted, I am still in my early stages of JavaScript thus, working with some things with regards to this project were very foreign. Like what is an API? 
As usual, I had steadily refer to some youtube tutorials to help me get an understanding of an API and how I was going to use it to create this web app. This project was 
also essential in helping me practice previously learnt concepts.
